## How to apply the keybindings
### Windows:
Run `setup.bat` or manually copy `user.bind` to `%appdata%\LyX2.3\bind\`.


### Non-Windows:

- Open LyX.
- Find the LyX user directory under `Help > About LyX > Version > User directory`
- Copy `user.bind` to the folder `bind` in the user directory.

After applying the keybindings you will need to restart LyX (any OS).
